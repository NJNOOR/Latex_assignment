# LaTeX Assignment (Created Using Overleaf)

This repository contains a **LaTeX assignment** which demonstrates my skills in technical writing and formatting using LaTeX. The document showcases various LaTeX features and is designed to help understand the basics and advanced functionalities of LaTeX.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Introduction to LaTeX**:
   - A brief overview of LaTeX and its purpose as a typesetting system.
   - Differences between LaTeX and traditional word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word).
   
2. **Document Structure**:
   - Basic structure of a LaTeX document including the preamble and content section.
   - How to organize content with sections and subsections.
   
3. **Text Formatting**:
   - Using LaTeX commands for formatting text such as bold, italic, underline, and more.
   - Combining multiple formatting styles.

4. **Mathematical Expressions**:
   - Typesetting inline and display math equations.
   - Examples of famous equations such as \( E = mc^2 \) and \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).

5. **Inserting Images and Figures**:
   - How to include images using the `graphicx` package.
   - Displaying multiple images side by side with captions.

6. **Tables**:
   - Creating tables with `tabular` and customizing them with colored cells.

7. **Advanced Features**:
   - Using `tcolorbox` for creating visually distinct colored boxes around quotes and other content.
   - Working with itemized and enumerated lists.

8. **Formatting References and Citations**:
   - How to add citations using the `natbib` package.
   - Including references and bibliography in the document.

9. **Equations and Mathematical Expressions**:
   - Using LaTeX to create advanced mathematical expressions such as summations, integrals, and matrices.

10. **Final Sections**:
    - Summary of the document.
    - Reference list and bibliography formatting.


## Files:
- **[LaTeX_Assignment.tex]**: The main LaTeX source file containing the LaTeX code.
- **[LaTeX_Assignment.pdf]**: The compiled PDF version of the LaTeX assignment.
- **[name.bib]**: The BibTeX file containing the bibliography entries.

## How to Use:
1. Download the LaTeX `.tex` file to view or edit the source code.
2. Download the `references.bib` file to include your bibliography.
3. Compile the `.tex` file using a LaTeX editor (I recommend using **Overleaf** for an easy, cloud-based experience).
4. View the **compiled PDF** to see the final result, with correctly formatted citations and bibliography.
