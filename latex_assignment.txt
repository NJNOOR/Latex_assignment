 \textcolor{purple}{Latex}(pronounced lay-tek) is a document preparation system for producing
professional-looking documents, it is not a word processor. It is particularly suited to producing long, structured documents, and is very good at type-setting equations. It is available as free software for most operating systems.
LATEX is based on TEX, a typesetting system designed by Donald Knuth in
1978 for high quality digital typesetting. TEX is a low-level language that
computers can work with, but most people would find difficult to use; so
LATEX has been developed to make it easier.
\\
\\
If you are used to producing documents with Microsoft Word, you will find
that LATEX is a very different style of working. Microsoft Word is ‘What You
See Is What You Get’ (WYSIWYG), this means that you see how the final
document will look as you are typing. When working in this way you will
probably make changes to the document’s appearance (such as line spacing,
headings, page breaks) as you type. With LATEX you do not see how the final
document will look while you are typing it — this allows you to concentrate
on the content rather than appearance.

\chapter{\textcolor{cyan}{Core Content}}
\section{The Basic of Latex}

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system used primarily for technical and scientific documents. Unlike word processors, LaTeX separates content creation from formatting, allowing authors to focus on the text while LaTeX manages the layout and style. Here are some foundational concepts that help new users get started with LaTeX:

\section{Document Structure}

A LaTeX document typically begins with a preamble where you set up the document class, load packages, and define any necessary settings. The preamble might look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
    \documentclass{report}
    \usepackage{graphicx} % For including images
\end{verbatim}    
After the preamble, the document content is written within the `document` environment. The basic structure looks like this:    
\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{document}
    % Content goes here
    \end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Formatting Text}

LaTeX provides several commands for text formatting. Some common commands include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bold text}
    \item \textit{Italic Text}
    \item \underline{underline text}
\end{itemize}
You can combine these commands for more complex formatting, such as `\textbf{\textit{bold and italic}}`.

\subsection{Creating Sections and Subsections}
In LaTeX, you can organize content using sections, subsections, and subsubsections. Each level of sectioning is automatically numbered and added to the table of contents (if you include one):

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Main Section}
\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mathematical Expressions}
One of LaTeX's most powerful features is its ability to typeset complex mathematical equations. Math expressions are placed between dollar signs for inline math, or in a dedicated `equation` environment for display equations:

\begin{verbatim}
inline math: (E = mc^2 )
display math :
\begin{equation}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}  
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Including image and Figures}
To insert images, use the `graphicx` package and the `figure` environment:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.png}
    \caption{An example image}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
These are the basics of working with LaTeX. By mastering these elements, you can create well-structured, professional-looking documents that are easy to read and navigate.

\section{Advance Features}
\subsection{Text Formatting, Lists, and Quotations}

Here are some ways to format text:
\textsc{small Caps Text}, \textsl{Slanted Text}, and \textbf{\textit{Italic and Bold}} for emphasis.
